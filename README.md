# Elizir

It's a slack chatbot, written in elixir, that will psychoanalyze you!  Based on [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA).

Just a crazy hack we made at [an OUDL meetup](https://hnl.io/events/169?n=Elixir%253A-Build-a-Slack-client-and-chat-server-(maybe))

Requires [lizbeth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lizbeth) on your path.

I also had to hack up lizbeth a bit.  Replace session.js with the one in the js folder.
